I often see people advocating for ecology in everyday life, on the Internet or in other medias. During discussions with my friends, during interview with our local politicians here in France, everywhere.

Weirdly, I don't see it being discussed as much in the tech industry. Some companies do green-washing to give themselves a better image, just like they do with openly being LGBT friendly. When there is money to be made, be sure that these companies will do what they can to give themselves a nice image. So as a reminder, 0 (zero) companies will be your friend. They are only here for cold, hard cash and nothing else.

When it comes to using the internet, I often feel that my experience is bloated. I sometimes have to use a slow network, for example when going back to the French countryside where if you are lucky you'll get 1Mb download speed when no one is using it, and I must say that using the Internet in general in this setting is a painful experience, but there is a clear distinction between sites that are well-built and sites that are clearly bloated.

The point I am trying to make is that if we want a greener Internet, we have a lot of things to change about the way we use the physical resources that powers it.
